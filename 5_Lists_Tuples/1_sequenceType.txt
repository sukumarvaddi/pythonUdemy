There are three basic sequence types. They are
1. List
2. Tuple
3. Range

A sequence is an ordered collection of items.
If the sequence were not ordered, it would be hard to access elements in the sequence by index.

Iterables: In python, anything you can iterate is an iterable. That means if you can use it in a "for" loop, it is an iterable.

The actual definition of an "iterable" is that it is an object that either has an "__iter__" method or "__getitem__" method. Indexing must also
start from zero.

All sequence types are iterables.

Not all iterables are sequences.
