# A tuple is a mathematical concept that represents an ordered collection of elements. In Python, a tuple is a built-in data type that allows you to store multiple items in a single variable. Tuples are similar to lists, but they have some key differences:
# 1. Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.
# 2. Tuples are defined using parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`.

t = "a", "b", "c"
# t = ("a", "b", "c")
print(t)

# parentheses needs to be used when passing tuples as arguments to function
